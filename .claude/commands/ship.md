# /ship - Deploy + Archive

## Purpose

Ship your work. Verifies everything is reviewed and audited, deploys to production, and archives the development cycle. The final step in the Golden Path.

**This is a Golden Path command.** It routes to the existing truename commands (`/deploy-production` + `/archive-cycle`) with readiness validation.

## Invocation

```
/ship               # Full ship flow (deploy + archive)
/ship --dry-run     # Preview what would happen
/ship --skip-deploy # Archive only (no deployment)
```

## Workflow

### 1. Check Ship Readiness

```bash
source .claude/scripts/golden-path.sh
if ! reason=$(golden_check_ship_ready); then
    # Not ready — show reason
    echo "$reason"
fi
```

Readiness requires:
- All sprints reviewed
- All sprints audited (APPROVED)

### 2. Show Summary (or Dry Run)

Display what will happen:
```
Ship Summary:
  Sprints: 3/3 complete
  Reviews: ✓ All approved
  Audits:  ✓ All approved

Actions:
  1. Deploy to production (/deploy-production)
  2. Archive cycle (/archive-cycle)

Proceed? [Y/n]
```

If `--dry-run`, stop here without executing.

### 3. Deploy

Unless `--skip-deploy`, execute `/deploy-production`.

### 4. Archive

Execute `/archive-cycle` to archive the completed development cycle.

### 5. Celebrate

```
🚀 Shipped!

  Deployed to production and archived cycle.
  Development cycle complete.

  Start a new cycle: /plan
```
