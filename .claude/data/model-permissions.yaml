      Primary agent. Runs natively in Claude Code with direct tool access.
      Subject to hook-layer safety (block-destructive-bash.sh) and deny
      rules (settings.deny.json). Full autonomy within safety boundaries.
      High trust across operational dimensions; governance reserved for
      human decision-making.

      Used for Flatline Protocol adversarial review and Bridgebuilder
      cross-model scoring. Read-only: receives document content via API,
      returns structured feedback. No tool access. All trust_scopes none
      because it operates as a stateless review oracle with no side effects.

      Deep reasoning model for architectural analysis. Thinking trace
      normalization required (Hounfour Cheval adapter). No tool access.
      All trust_scopes none — stateless analysis oracle.

      Local code generation model. Can read and write files but cannot
      execute commands or access network. All writes subject to the same
      hook-layer safety as Claude Code session. Medium data_access reflects
      file read/write capability within sandboxed boundaries. DeltaNet/Attention
      hybrid architecture handles sequential state differently — may need
      different context engineering for optimal performance.

    notes: >
      Used for Flatline Protocol primary review. Receives documents via
      API, returns structured analysis. Higher trust_level than other
      remote models due to Anthropic's safety training, but all trust_scopes
      none when used as a remote model — no direct side effects. Trust
      asymmetry (high trust_level, none scopes) reflects the distinction
      between inherent model trustworthiness and operational permissions.
