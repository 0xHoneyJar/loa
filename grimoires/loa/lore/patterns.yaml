  term: Governance Isomorphism
  short: >-
    Access to scarce resources governed through multi-perspective evaluation
    with fail-closed semantics. Appears identically in Flatline (model consensus),
    Red Team (attack/defense), and HoneyJar vault governance (on-chain multisig).
  context: >-
    The review pipeline and the vault share an identical governance shape:
    multiple independent evaluators must reach consensus before state changes
    are permitted, with the default being rejection. In Flatline, two+ models
    must agree before findings auto-integrate. In Red Team, attacker and
    defender perspectives must both be satisfied. In HoneyJar vaults,
    multi-sig holders must agree before funds move. This is not coincidence —
    it is the same pattern applied at different scales. The insight enables
    cross-pollination: security review patterns from code review can inform
    on-chain governance design, and vice versa. Elinor Ostrom's commons
    governance principles (graduated sanctions, collective-choice arrangements)
    describe why this pattern works across domains.
