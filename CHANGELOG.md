## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-20

### Why This Release

Claude Code has a tendency to proactively suggest git operations—committing changes, creating PRs, and pushing to remotes—which can be problematic when working in forked repositories. Developers using Loa as a template for their own projects were at risk of accidentally pushing proprietary code to the public upstream repository (`0xHoneyJar/loa`).

This release introduces comprehensive safety rails to prevent these accidents while still enabling intentional contributions back to the framework.

### Added
- **Git Safety Protocol**: Multi-layer protection against accidental pushes to upstream template repository
  - 4-layer template detection system (origin URL, upstream remote, loa remote, GitHub API)
  - Automatic detection during `/setup` with results stored in marker file
  - Warnings before push/PR operations targeting upstream
  - Prevents accidentally leaking project-specific code to the public Loa repository

- **`/contribute` command**: Guided OSS contribution workflow for contributing back to Loa
  - Pre-flight checks (feature branch, clean working tree, upstream remote)
  - Standards checklist (clean commits, no secrets, tests, DCO)
  - Automated secrets scanning with common patterns (API keys, tokens, credentials)
  - DCO sign-off verification with fix guidance
  - Guided PR creation with proper formatting
  - Handles both fork-based and direct repository contributions

- **Template detection in `/setup`**: New Phase 0.5 detects fork/template relationships
  - Runs before user-type selection
  - Displays safety notice when template detected
  - Stores detection metadata in `.loa-setup-complete` marker file

- **`/config` command**: Post-setup MCP server reconfiguration (THJ only)
  - Allows adding/removing MCP integrations after initial setup
  - Shows currently configured servers
  - Updates marker file with new configuration

### Changed
- **Setup marker file schema**: Now includes `template_source` object with detection metadata
  ```json
  {
    "template_source": {
      "detected": true,
      "repo": "0xHoneyJar/loa",
      "detection_method": "origin_url",
      "detected_at": "2025-12-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Git Safety Protocol documentation and `/contribute` command reference
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated with contribution workflow using `/contribute` command
- **Documentation**: Updated setup flow diagrams and command reference tables

### Security
- **Secrets scanning**: `/contribute` scans for common secret patterns before PR creation
  - AWS access keys (AKIA...)
  - GitHub tokens (ghp_...)
  - Slack tokens (xox...)
  - Private keys (-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)
  - Generic password/secret/api_key patterns
- **DCO enforcement**: Contribution workflow verifies Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
- **Template isolation**: Prevents accidental code leakage from forked projects to upstream

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **`/setup` command**: First-time onboarding workflow
  - Guided MCP server configuration (GitHub, Linear, Vercel, Discord, web3-stats)
  - Project initialization (git user info, project name detection)
  - Creates `.loa-setup-complete` marker file
  - Setup enforcement: `/plan-and-analyze` now requires setup completion
- **`/feedback` command**: Developer experience survey
  - 4-question survey with progress indicators
  - Linear integration: posts to "Loa Feedback" project
  - Analytics attachment: includes usage.json in feedback
  - Pending feedback safety net: saves locally before submission
- **`/update` command**: Framework update mechanism
  - Pre-flight checks (clean working tree, remote verification)
  - Fetch, preview, and confirm workflow
  - Merge conflict guidance per file type
  - CHANGELOG excerpt display after update
- **Analytics system**: Usage tracking for feedback context
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/usage.json` for raw metrics
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/summary.md` for human-readable summary
  - Tracks: phases, sprints, reviews, audits, deployments
  - Non-blocking: failures logged but don't interrupt workflows
  - Opt-in sharing: only sent via `/feedback` command

### Changed
- **Fresh template**: Removed all generated loa-grimoire content (PRD, SDD, sprint plans, A2A files) so new projects start clean
- All phase commands now update analytics on completion
- `/plan-and-analyze` blocks if setup marker is missing
- `/deploy-production` suggests running `/feedback` after deployment
- Documentation updated: CLAUDE.md, PROCESS.md, README.md
- Repository structure now includes `loa-grimoire/analytics/` directory
- `.gitignore` updated with setup marker and pending feedback entries
